==========

A project for NSS to create a website that tracks baseball scores.
Eric Wright is now a contributor to this project.

The site uses Bootstrap to manage a sports league consisting of 4-8 teams.

Add a Team:
Team managers enter their team information. The team name is then populated into the standings table (and saved to a server).
Data must be entered into each field and the phone number and zip code must be 10 and 5 digits respectively.
If you hover over the team name in the standings the team information is displayed.
Once 8 teams have been added the league is full and no more teams can be entered.

Create Schedule:
If there are more than 4 teams a schedule is generated based on the number of teams.
If there are an odd number of teams then one team will have a bye each week.

Calculate Week:
The scores for each game that week are prompted for and then listed in the Schedule/Results table.

Update Standings:
The standings table is updated with wins and losses from the week and the list is sortable if you click the column heading.

Start New Season:
Once the season is over this button wipes out the data from that season so a new season can start.
The data is not wiped out if the user refreshes at any point until this button is clicked.
After clicking the site will be ready for a new season upon refresh.
